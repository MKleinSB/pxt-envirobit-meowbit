## enviro:bit

This package adds support for the Pimoroni enviro:bit to arcade.makecode.com

An enviro:bit is required to use this package, grab yours here: https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro-bit

## JavaScript Reference

### Air & Weather

enviro:bit is equipped with a bme280 capable of reading the temperature, pressure and humidity of your environment.

The following functions return the temperature, pressure and humidity in standard formats with low precision - useful for basic programs and flows.

* `envirobit.getTemperature()` - Returns the temperature in degrees celcius as a whole number: 15, 16, 25, 26 etc
* `envirobit.getPressure()` - Returns the pressure in hPa as a whole number
* `envirobit.getHumidity()` - Returns the relative humidity (a percentage) as a whole number

Each of these functions has a "Fine" equivilent ( available in "Advanced" in block view ) which returns the same value with a higher precision - useful for logging or responding to small changes:

* `envirobit.getTemperatureFine()` - Returns the temperature in hundredths of a degree celcius as a whole number: eg: 1525 represents 15.25 degrees
* `envirobit.getPressure()` - Returns the pressure in pascals, 100 pascals = 1 hectopascal
* `envirobit.getHumidity()` - Returns the humdity in hundreths of a percent: eg: 7515 represents 75.15% relative humidity

For example, this script will scroll the current temperature across micro:bit's display:

```typescript
basic.forever(() => {
    basic.showNumber(envirobit.getTemperature())
})
```

### Colour & Light

enviro:bit is also equipped with a tcs3472 colour sensor which consists of multiple light sensors filtered with different coloured windows.

It measures the light level with a clear filter, plus the level of Red, Green and Blue light with appropriate filters.

The following functions get the proportional amount of each colour, adjusted against the light level to the range 0-255:

* `envirobit.getRed()`
* `envirobit.getGreen()`
* `envirobit.getBlue()`

To read the absolute light level, use `envirobit.getLight()`.

### Sound

Finally, enviro:bit has a mems microphone which senses the amount of noise in your environment. It's great for detecting loud sounds like claps or shouts so your program can respond to them.

PAY ATTENTION!!! Sound slows down Arcade and crashes after a while!

* `envirobit.onClap(() => {})` - Perform an action when a clap is detected
* `envirobit.timeSinceLastClap()` - Get the time (in milliseconds) since a clap was last detected
* `envirobit.waitForClap(timeout=1000)` - DEPRECATED - Wait timeout milliseconds for a clap, return true if one is heard, false if not
* `envirobit.waitForDoubleClap(timeout=1000)` - DEPRECATED - Wait timeout milliseconds for a double clap, return true if one is heard, false if not

The sensitivity of `waitForClap` and `waitForDoubleClap` can be tweaked:

* `envirobit.setClapSensitivity(value)` - Set the sensitivity for clap detection (0-100), a higher number means quiter claps will be recognised but other noises might be too!

You can also get the sound level:

* `envirobit.getSoundLevel()` - Returns the current sound level, should return 0 to +-443.

Or the noise level, averaged over 5 samples:

* `envirobit.getNoiseLevel()` - Returns the current noise level, smoothed over time

For example this script will toggle micro:bit's LED display on and off when you clap:

```typescript
let lights = false

envirobit.setClapSensitivity(80)

envirobit.onClap(() => {
    lights = !(lights)
    if (lights) {
        basic.showLeds(`
            . . # . .
            . # # # .
            # # # # #
            . # # # .
            . . # . .
            `)
    } else {
        basic.clearScreen()
    }
})
```

And to do something on double clap and additionally clear the screen after no clap is heard for 2 seconds, you could do:

```typescript
envirobit.onClap(() => {
    if (envirobit.timeSinceLastClap() < 500) {
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)
    }
})
basic.forever(() => {
    if (envirobit.timeSinceLastClap() > 2000) {
        basic.clearScreen()
    }
})
```

To detect triple/quadruple claps you could increment a counter and perform your action when it reaches the desired number.
